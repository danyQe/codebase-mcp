# General Purpose Development System Prompt

"""
This file contains the general-purpose system prompt for Codebase MCP.
It configures the LLM as an autonomous software developer capable of working
across multiple languages and frameworks.

To use this prompt in Claude, expose it via MCP:

```python
@mcp.prompt(name="system_prompt")
def system_prompt() -> str:
    return GENERAL_DEV_PROMPT
